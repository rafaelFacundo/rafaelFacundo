### Hi wellcome to my github 👋

  I'm a Computer Science graduate from Brazil and a software developer with experience across web, mobile, and desktop applications. I enjoy building well-structured, high-performance solutions and care a lot about clean code and good engineering practices.

Lately, my interests have been moving strongly toward computer vision, and image processing, especially applied to sports and real-world problems.

  This is my latest project: a desktop video player built with TypeScript, React, Electron, and Redux.

It's not just a simple video player, while watching a video, you can click on any English word you don’t know to instantly see its meaning and save it directly to Anki for later review.

The project was created to solve a real problem from my daily life and support my English studies. Before this, I had to pause the video, search for the word in a browser, and manually add it to Anki. With this app, the entire process takes just two clicks.

You can see an example in the video below:
